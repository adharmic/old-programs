# old-programs

This is a repository full of all the old programs I had to make for old classes or things that I messed around with in another time.

These programs are generally written in Java but there are a few C# files I have messed around with.

Some of this code was written when I was just barely getting into programming - this means that code conventions and standards are probably not up to par. Apologies in advance.
